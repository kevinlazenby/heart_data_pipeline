## Code chunk #1: Data import
To import data, save the SAF files in `.sas7bdat` format to a folder in your working directory. For example, save the SAF files in a folder named `pubsaf2206`, which is a subfolder within the working directory for the R project. The variable `curr_data_release` stores the name of this folder so that the script loads in the data from the correct folder.
